                <h6>Why we do it</h6>
                <p class="text-services">Farmers are plagued with problems affecting their productivity and livelihood--middlemen only offering meager prices for their produce, cereal boards delaying with payments, and expensive farm inputs.</p>
				<p>M-Farm gives these farmers a voice by connecting them with each other in a virtual space. With M-Farm,they not get affordable farm inputs but also are able to sell collectively</p>

                <h6>How we do it</h6>
                <p class="text-services">Since many farmers do not have access to internet, M-Farm has adopted an SMS-based solution where they send a simple text to 3555 depending on what they are looking for.</p>
